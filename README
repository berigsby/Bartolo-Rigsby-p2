## Reflection
This project seemed daunting at first. The labs building up
to it didn't go too well, so we were scared at first. Trying to
created out own TUI seemed almost impossible. However, after putting
out code together, and then entirely reworking how our files were
stored, we created a program were quiet proud of. I really enjoyed
the various testing to input characters into char arrays and creating
certain cases to test for different things. We also got a fair bit
of experience creating our own classes seperately, then coming togther
and using them to make something that actually works. The various cases
checking for file creation and saving was a bit tricky, but we got it
working in the end.

A couple things to note is that we did add line numbers and color
for the extra credit section. Also, if no file is specified when calling
the function, we automatically ask for a file first thing in the program.
